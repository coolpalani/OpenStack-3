Dashboard Integration

Optionally, Neutron LBaaS v2 integration can be added to the Horizon dasboard by installing the openstack-neutron-lbaas and openstack-neutron-lbaas-ui plugins with yum.

# yum -y install openstack-neutron-lbaas openstack-neutron-lbaas-ui

Once the packages have been installed, enable LBaaS in Horizon by changing the enable_lb value in /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings from False to True:

OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK = {
'enable_distributed_router': False,
'enable_firewall': False,
'enable_ha_router': False,
'enable_lb': True,
'enable_quotas': True,
'enable_security_group': True,
'enable_vpn': False,
'profile_support': None,

After saving and closing the file, restart Apache and memcached.

# systemctl restart httpd memcached

Now you should be able to view, create, and manage Neutron LBaaS under Projects –> Networking –> Load Balancers in the Horizon web dashboard.
